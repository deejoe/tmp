An example of [wrapping a 
link](http://example.com) to see what pandoc makes of it.


Well, my version of pandoc seemed to like it fine. Joe's (joe's own editor)
syntax highlighting doesn't like it though.

Let's see what Github makes of it, now.

Github handles it fine. Next test will be Gitlab, and then maybe we'll see
about other editor's and their syntax highlighting.
